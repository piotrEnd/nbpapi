**Information architecture:**

I maintain my commitment to controlling expenses. The app manages multiple currencies using real-time official exchange rates. The result is calculated on the fly and can be switched between currencies using radio buttons.

**Design:**

The app fetches data from the [NBP Web API](http://api.nbp.pl/en.html) using an async/await approach. The typography choice aligns with the accountant-style. The vibrant blue evokes a sense of trust and innovation. The fluorescent green shadowing from inputs encourages action.
